# Creating a VPC using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console
{: #creating-a-vpc-using-the-ibm-cloud-console}

This guide shows you how to create and configure an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Virtual Private Cloud using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

To create and configure your virtual private cloud (VPC) and other attached resources, perform the steps in the sections that follow, in this order:

1. Create a VPC and subnet to define the network. When you create your subnet, attach a public gateway to allow all resources in the subnet to communicate with the public internet. 
1. Configure an access control list (ACL) to limit the subnet's inbound and outbound traffic. By default, all traffic is allowed.
1. Create a virtual server instance.
1. Create a block storage volume and attach it to an instance.
1. Configure a security group to define the inbound and outbound traffic that's allowed for the instance.
1. Reserve and associate a floating IP address to enable your instance to be reachable from the internet.
1. Create a load balancer to distribute requests over multiple instances.
1. Create a virtual private network (VPN) so your VPC can connect securely to another private network, such as your on-premises network or another VPC.

## Before you begin
{: #before}
Make sure you have sufficient permissions to create and manage resources in your VPC. For more information, see [Managing user permissions for VPC resources](/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources).

Generate an SSH key, which will be used to connect to the virtual server instance. For example, generate an SSH key on your Linux server by running the command `ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "user_ID"`. That command generates two files. The generated public key is in the `<your key>.pub` file.

If you plan to create a load balancer and use HTTPs for the listener, an SSL certificate is required. You can manage certificates with [IBM Certificate Manager ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/catalog/services/certificate-manager){: new_window}. You must also create an authorization to allow your load balancer instance to access the Certificate Manager instance that contains the SSL certificate. You can create an authorization through [Identity and Access Authorizations ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/iam/#/authorizations){: new_window}. For the source, select **Infrastructure Service** as the Source service, **Load Balancer for VPC** as the Resource type, and **All resource instances** for the Source resource instance. Select **Certificate Manager** as the Target service and assign **Writer** for the service access role. Set the Target service instance to  **All instances** or to your specific Certificate Manager instance. For more information, see [Using Load Balancers in IBM Cloud VPC](/docs/infrastructure/vpc-network?topic=vpc-network---beta-using-load-balancers-in-ibm-cloud-vpc).

## Creating a VPC and subnet

To create a VPC and subnet:

1. Open [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}){: new_window}
1. Click **Menu icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > VPC Infrastructure > Network > VPC and subnets** and click **New virtual private cloud**.
1. Enter a name for the VPC, such as `my-vpc`.
1. Select a resource group for the VPC and all its attached resources. Resource groups enable you to organize your account resources for access control and billing purposes. For more information, see [Best practices for organizing resources in a resource group](/docs/resources?topic=resources-bp_resourcegroups).
1. _Optional:_ Enter tags to help you organize and find your resources. You can add more tags later. For more information, see [Working with tags](/docs/resources?topic=resources-tag).
1. Select or create the default ACL for new subnets in this VPC. In this tutorial, let's create a new default ACL. We'll configure rules for the ACL later.
1. Select whether the default security group allows inbound SSH and ping traffic to virtual server instances in this VPC. We'll configure more rules for the default security group later.
1. Enter a name for the new subnet in your VPC, such as `my-subnet`.
1. Select a location for the subnet. The location consists of a region and a zone.

    The region you select is used as the region of the VPC. All additional resources you create in this VPC will be created in the selected region.
    {: tip}

1. Enter an IP range for the subnet in CIDR notation, for example: `10.240.0.0/24`. In most cases, you can use the default IP range. If you want to specify a custom IP range, you can use the IP range calculator to select a different address prefix or change the number of addresses.
1. Select an ACL for the subnet. Select **Use VPC default** to use the default ACL that's created for this VPC.
1. Attach a public gateway to the subnet to allow all attached resources to communicate with the public internet.  

    You can also attach the public gateway after you create the subnet.
    {: tip}

1. Click **Create virtual private cloud**.
1. To create another subnet in this VPC, click the **Subnets** tab and click **New subnet**. When you define the subnet, make sure to select `my_vpc` in the **Virtual private cloud** field.

## Configuring the ACL

You can configure the ACL to limit inbound and outbound traffic to the subnet. By default, all traffic is allowed.

Each subnet can be attached to only one ACL. However, each ACL can be attached to multiple subnets.

To configure the ACL:

1. On the VPC and subnets page, click the **Subnets** tab.
1. Click the subnet that you created.
1. In the **Subnet details** area, click the name of the ACL.
1. Click **Add rule** to configure inbound and outbound rules that define what traffic is allowed in or out of the subnet. For each rule, specify the following information:  
   * Specify the rule's priority. Rules with lower numbers are evaluated first and override rules with higher numbers. For example, if a rule with priority 2 allows HTTP traffic and a rule with priority 5 denies all traffic, HTTP traffic is still allowed.  
   * Select whether to allow or deny the specified traffic.  
   * Specify a CIDR block to indicate the IP range for which the rule applies.
   * Select the protocols and ports to which the rule applies.
1. When you finish creating rules, click the **All access control lists** breadcrumb at the top of the page.

### Example ACL

For example, you can configure inbound rules that do the following:

 1. Allow HTTP traffic from the internet
 1. Allow all inbound traffic from the subnet 10.10.20.0/24
 1. Deny all other inbound traffic  

Then, configure outbound rules that do the following:

1. Allow HTTP traffic to the internet
1. Allow all outbound traffic to the subnet 10.10.20.0/24
1. Deny all other outbound traffic  

![Shows the sample inbound and outbound rules](images/acl-rules.png)

## Creating a virtual server instance

To create a virtual server instance in the newly created subnet:

1. Click **Compute > Virtual server instance** in the navigation pane and click **New instance**.
1. Enter a name for the instance, such as `my-instance`.
1. Select the VPC that you created.
1. In the **Location** field, select the zone in which to create the instance.
1. Select an image (that is, operating system and version) such as Ubuntu Linux 16.04.
1. To set the instance size, select one of the popular profiles or click **All profiles** to choose a different core and RAM combination that's most appropriate for your workload.
1. Select an existing SSH key or add a new SSH key that will be used to access the virtual server instance. To add an SSH key, click **New key** and name the key. After you enter your previously generated public key value, click **Add SSH key**.

Keys only can be added initially as part of creating the VSI. No tooling exists to add keys later.
{:tip}

1. _Optional:_ Enter user data to run common configuration tasks when your instance starts. For example, you can specify cloud-init directives or shell scripts for Linux images. For more information, see [User Data](/docs/vsi-is?topic=virtual-servers-is-user-data).
1. Note the boot volume. In the current release, 100 GB is allotted for the boot volume. *Auto Delete* is enabled for the volume; it will be deleted automatically if the instance is deleted.
1. In the **Attached block storage volume** area, you can click **New block storage volume** to attach a block storage volume to your instance. In this tutorial, we'll create a block storage volume and attach it to the instance later.
1. In the **Network interfaces** area, you can edit the network interface and change its name and port speed. If you have more than one subnet in the selected zone and VPC, you can attach a different subnet to the interface. If you want the instance to exist in multiple subnets, you can create more interfaces.

   You can also select which security groups to attach to each interface. By default, the VPC's default security group is attached. The default security group allows inbound SSH and ping traffic, all outbound traffic, and all traffic between instances in the group. All other traffic is blocked; you can configure rules to allow more traffic. If you later edit the rules of the default security group, those updated rules will apply to all current and future instances in the group.

1. Click **Create virtual server instance**. The status of the instance starts as *Pending*, changes to *Stopped*, and then *Powered On*. You might need to refresh the page to see the change in status.

## Creating and attaching a block storage volume

You can create a block storage volume and attach it to your virtual server instance.

To create and attach a block storage volume:

1. In the navigation pane, click **Storage > Block storage volumes**.
1. On the Block storage volumes for VPC page, click **New volume** and specify the following information.
  * **Name**: Enter a name for the block storage volume, such as `data-volume-1`.  
  * **Resource group**: Select a resource group for the block storage volume. Resource groups enable you to organize your account resources for access control and billing purposes. For more information, see [Best practices for organizing resources in a resource group](/docs/resources?topic=resources-bp_resourcegroups).
  * **Tags**: _Optional:_ Enter tags to help you organize and find your resources. You can add more tags later. For more information, see [Working with tags](/docs/resources?topic=resources-tag).
  * **Location**: Select a location for the block storage volume. The location consists of a region and a zone, for example US South 1.
  * **Size**: Specify the size of the volume between 10 GBs and 2000 GBs.
  * **IOPs**: Select one of the IOPs Tiers or click Custom to enter an IOPs value based on volume size.
  * **Encryption**: Accept the default Provider managed encryption or select Customer managed and use your own encryption key. This step requires provisioning a Key Protect service instance and creating or importing a root key. For more information, see [Creating block storage volumes with customer managed encryption](/docs/infrastructure/block-storage-is?topic=block-storage-is-block-storage-encryption#data-vol-encryption-ui).
1. Click **Create volume**.
1. In the list of block storage volumes, find the volume that you created. When the status is Available, click "..." and select **Attach to instance**.
1. Select the instance to which you want to attach the volume and click **Attach**.

## Configuring the security group for the instance

You can configure the security group to define the inbound and outbound traffic that is allowed for the instance. For example, after you configure ACL rules for the subnet based on your company's security policies, you can further restrict traffic for specific instances depending on their workloads.

To configure the security group:

1. On the Virtual server instances page, click your instance to view its details.
1. In the **Network interfaces** section, click the security group.
1. Click **Add rule** to configure inbound and outbound rules that define what type of traffic is allowed to and from the instance. For each rule, specify the following information:  
   * Specify a CIDR block or IP address for the permitted traffic. Alternatively, you can specify a security group in the same VPC to allow traffic to or from all instances attached to the selected security group.   
   * Select the protocols and ports to which the rule applies.    

   **Tips:**  
  * All rules are evaluated, regardless of the order in which they're added.
  * Rules are stateful, which means that return traffic in response to allowed traffic is automatically permitted. For example, a rule that allows inbound TCP traffic on port 80 also allows replying outbound TCP traffic on port 80 back to the originating host, without the need for an additional rule.
1. _Optional:_ If you want to attach this security group to other instances, click **Attached interfaces** in the navigation pane and select additional interfaces.
1. When you finish creating rules, click the **All security groups** breadcrumb at the top of the page.

### Example security group  

For example, you can configure inbound rules that do the following:

 * Allow all SSH traffic (TCP port 22)
 * Allow all ping traffic (ICMP type 8)

Then, configure outbound rules that allow all TCP traffic.

## Reserving a floating IP address

Reserve and associate a floating IP address to enable your instance to be reachable from the internet.  

Your instance must be running before you can associate a floating IP address. It can take a few minutes for the instance to be up and running.
{: tip}

To reserve and associate a floating IP address:

1. On the Virtual server instances page, click your instance to view its details.
1. In the **Network interfaces** section, click **Reserve** for the interface that you want to associate with a floating IP address.

If you later want to reassign this floating IP address to another instance in the same zone, find the floating IP address on the **Network > Floating IPs** page, click its overflow menu (**...**), and click **Unassociate**. Then, click  **Associate** to select the instance and network interface that you want to associate with the floating IP address.
{: tip}

## Connecting to your instance
Using the floating IP address that you created, ping your instance to make sure it's up and running:

```
ping <public-ip-address>
```
{:pre}


### Connecting to Linux images

Since you created your instance with a public SSH key, you can now connect to it directly by using your private key:


```
ssh -i <path-to-private-key-file> root@<public-ip-address>
```
{:pre}

See [Connecting to your instance using Linux](/docs/vsi-is?topic=virtual-servers-is-connecting-to-your-linux-instance) for more information on how to connect to your instance.

### Connecting to Windows images
To connect to a Windows image, log in using its decrypted password. To get the decrypted password, copy the encrypted password from the instance's details page and run the following command:

```
# Decode the encrypted password
cat ~/examplepwd | base64 --decode > ~/examplepwd64
# Decrypt the decoded password using the RSA private key
openssl pkeyutl -in ~/examplepwd64 -decrypt -inkey private.pem -pkeyopt rsa_padding_mode:oaep -pkeyopt rsa_oaep_md:sha256
-pkeyopt rsa_mgf1_md:sha256
```
{:codeblock}


See [Connecting to your Windows instance](/docs/vsi-is?topic=virtual-servers-is-connecting-to-your-windows-instance) for more information on how to connect to your instance.



## Monitoring your instance

For an activity log that shows when the instance was started, stopped, or rebooted, click **Activity** in the navigation pane.

## Creating a load balancer
You can create a load balancer to distribute inbound traffic across multiple instances.

To create a load balancer:
1. In the navigation pane, click **Network > Load balancers**.
1. On the Load balancers page, click **New load balancer** and specify the following information.
    * **Name**: Enter a name for the load balancer, such as `my-load-balancer`.
    * **Virtual private cloud**: Select your VPC.
    * **Resource group**: Select a resource group for the load balancer.
    * **Type**: Select load balancer type, Public or Private.
    * **Region**: Indicates the region in which the  load balancer will be created; that is, the region selected for your VPC.
    * **Subnets**: Select the subnets in which to create your load balancer. To maximize the availability of your application, select subnets in different zones.
1. Click **New pool** and specify the following information to create a back-end pool. You can create one or more pools.
    * **Name**: Enter a name for the pool, such as `my-pool`.
    * **Protocol**: Select the protocol for your back-end instances behind the load balancer. The protocol of the pool must match the protocol of its associated listener. For example, if an HTTPS or HTTP protocol is selected for the listener, the protocol of the pool must be HTTP. Similarly, if the listener protocol is TCP, the protocol of the back-end pool must be TCP.
    * **Method**:  Select how you want the load balancer to distribute traffic across the back-end instances:
      * **Round robin:** Forward requests to each instance in turn. All instances receive approximately an equal number of client connections.
      * **Weighted Round robin:** Forward requests to each instance in proportion to its assigned weight. For example, if you have instances A, B, and C, and their weights are set to 60, 60 and 30, then instances A and B receive an equal number of connections, and instance C receives half as many connections.
      * **Least connections:** Forward requests to the instance with the least number of connections at the current time.  
    * **Session stickiness**: Select whether all requests during a user's session are sent to the same instance.  
    * **Health checks**: Configure how the load balancer checks the health of the instances.
      * **Health protocol**: The protocol used by the load balancer to send health check messages to the back-end instances.
      * **Health path**: Health path is applicable only if HTTP is selected as the health check protocol. The health path specifies the URL used by the load balancer to send the HTTP health check requests to the back-end instances. By default, health checks are sent to the root path (`/`).
      * **Interval**: Interval in seconds between two consecutive health check attempts. By default, health checks are sent every five seconds.
      * **Timeout**: Maximum amount of time the system waits for a response from a health check request. By default, the load balancer waits two seconds for a response.
      * **Max retries**: Maximum number of additional health check attempts that the load balancer makes before declaring a back-end instance unhealthy. By default, an instance is no longer considered healthy after two failed health checks.

        Although the load balancer stops sending connections to unhealthy instances, the load balancer continues monitoring the health of these instances and resumes their use if they're found healthy again by successfully passing two consecutive health check attempts.

      If back-end instances are unhealthy and you believe your application is running fine, double check the health protocol and health path values. Also check any security groups attached to the instances to ensure the rules allow traffic between the load balancer and the instances.
      {: tip}

1. Click **Create**.
1. Next to the entry for the new pool, click **Attach** in the **Instances** column to add an instance to the pool. Click **Add** to add more instances to the pool. Specify the following information for each instance:
   * Select one or more subnets from which to select an instance.
   * Select an instance. If an instance has multiple interfaces, make sure you select the correct IP address.
   * Specify the port on which traffic is sent to the instance.
   * If your pool uses the **Weighted round robin** method, assign a weight for each instance.  

      Assigning '0' weight to an instance means no new connections will be forwarded to that instance, but any existing traffic continues to flow as long as the current connection is active. Using a weight of '0' can help bring down an instance gracefully and remove it from service rotation.
      {: tip}

1. Click **New listener** and specify the following information to create a listener. You can create one or more listeners.
   * **Protocol**: The protocol to use for receiving incoming requests.
   * **Port**: The listening port on which requests are received. The port range of 56500 to 56520 is reserved for management purposes and can't be used.
   * **Back-end pool**: The back-end pool to which this listener forwards traffic.
   * **Max connections** (optional): Maximum number of concurrent connections the listener allows.
   * **SSL certificate**: If HTTPS is the selected protocol for this listener, you must select an SSL certificate. Make sure the load balancer is authorized to access the SSL certificate. For instructions, see [Before you begin](#before).
1. Click **Create**.
1. After you finish creating pools and listeners, click **Create load balancer**.
1. To view details of an existing load balancer, click the name of your load balancer on the **Load balancers** page.

## Creating a VPN
You can create a virtual private network (VPN) so your VPC can connect securely to another private network, such as an on-premises network or another VPC.

To view a code example, see [Using VPN with your VPC](/docs/infrastructure/vpc-network?topic=vpc-network---beta-using-vpn-with-your-vpc).
{: tip}

To create a VPN:
1. In the navigation pane, click **Network > VPNs**.
1. On the VPN page, click **New VPN gateway** and specify the following information:
    * **Name**: Enter a name for the VPN gateway in your virtual private cloud, such as `my-vpn-gateway`.
    * **Virtual private cloud**: Select your VPC.
    * **Resource group**: Select a resource group for the VPN.
    * **Subnet**: Select the subnet in which to create the VPN gateway.
1. In the **New VPN connection** section, define a connection between this gateway and a network outside your VPC by specifying the following information.
    * **Connection name**: Enter a name for the connection, such as `my-connection`.
    * **Peer gateway address**: Specify the IP address of the VPN gateway for the network outside your VPC.
    * **Preshared key**: Specify the authentication key of the VPN gateway for the network outside your VPC.
    * **Local subnets**: Specify one or more subnets in the VPC you want to connect through the VPN tunnel.
    * **Peer subnets**: Specify one or more subnets in the other network you want to connect through the VPN tunnel.
1. To configure how the cloud gateway sends messages to check that the peer gateway is active, specify the following information in the **Dead peer detection** section.
    * **Dead peer detection action**: The action to take if a peer gateway stops responding. For example, select **Restart** if you want the gateway to immediately renegotiate the connection.
    * **Interval**: How often to check that the peer gateway is active. By default, messages are sent every 30 seconds.
    * **Timeout**: How long to wait for a response from the peer gateway. By default, a peer gateway is no longer considered active if a response isn't received within 150 seconds.
1. Specify the IKE and IPsec security parameters for the connection.
    * Select **Auto** if you want the cloud gateway to try to automatically establish the connection.
    * Select or create custom policies if you need to enforce particular security requirements, or the VPN gateway for the other network doesn't support the security proposals that are tried by auto-negotiation.

  **Important**: The IKE and IPsec security parameters that you specify for the connection must be the same parameters that are set on the gateway for the network outside your VPC.

## Congratulations!

You've successfully created and configured a VPC and subnet, an ACL, a virtual server instance, block storage volume, security group, floating IP address, load balancer, and VPN. You can continue to develop your VPC by adding more instances, subnets, and other resources.
