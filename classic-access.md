# Setting up access to your Classic Infrastructure from VPC
{: #setting-up-access-to-your-classic-infrastructure-from-vpc}

You may set up access to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Classic Infrastructure, including Direct Link connectivity, from one VPC in each region, for any account. These special "Classic Access VPCs" use the same implicit router as your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} classic infrastructure.

When you've set up a VPC for classic access, every compute host (VSI or Bare Metal) in your classic account can send and receive packets to and from the classic access VPC. However, remember that firewalls, gateways, Network ACLs, or security groups can filter this traffic. As a best practice, we recommend that you allow only the traffic that's required for your applications to function properly.

## Pre-requisites:
1. Your classic account must be linked to your IBM Cloud account. See [Linking IBMid accounts](/docs/account/softlayerlink.html) for instructions on how to do this.
1. Your classic account must be enabled for VRF.
    * If you already have Direct Link on your account, you are ready.
    * If your account is not VRF-enabled, open a ticket to request "VRF Migration" for your account. See [How you can initiate the conversion](/docs/infrastructure/direct-link?topic=direct-link-how-you-can-initiate-the-conversion) in our Direct Link documentation to learn more about the conversion process.

Firewalls, gateways, Network ACLs, or security groups can filter out some or all of the network traffic between Classic and VPC resources.

## Create a Classic Access VPC
You can create a VPC with Classic Access capability by using the User Interface (UI), Command Line Interface (CLI), or Application Programming Interface (API).

A VPC must be set up for Classic Access when it's created: you cannot update a VPC to add or remove the Classic Access capability.
{: note}

### Create a Classic Access VPC from the User Interface

Create a Classic Access VPC from the **Create VPC** page, by clicking on the checkbox titled **Enable access to classic resource**, under the **Classic access** label.

### Create a Classic Access VPC using the CLI

Use the flag `--classic-access` when creating the VPC. For example,

```
ibmcloud is vpc-create my-access-vpc --classic-access
```
{: pre}


### Create a Classic Access VPC using the API

Pass in the `classic_access` parameter when creating the VPC. For example,

```bash
curl -X POST $rias_endpoint/v1/vpcs?version=2019-01-01 \
  -H "Authorization: $iam_token" \
  -d '{
        "name": "my-access-vpc",
        "classic_access": true
      }'
```
{: pre}


## Limitations

* Only your private (back) networks will be connected to your account's private implicit router.
* Only subnets allocated with classic APIs are connected to the classic side of your private implicit router. Subnets on classic VLANs are not routed by the implicit router.
* Only one VPC per region, per account can be enabled for Classic Access.
