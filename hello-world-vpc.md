# Creating a VPC using the IBM Cloud CLI
{: #creating-a-vpc-using-the-ibm-cloud-cli}

This guide shows you how to create {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Virtual Private Cloud resources using the IBM Cloud CLI.

## Pre-requisites:
{: #cli-pre-requisites}

1. Install the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/index.html#overview).

2. Install or update the `infrastructure-service` plugin to the IBM Cloud CLI.

  To install:

  ```
  ibmcloud plugin install infrastructure-service
  ```
  {: pre}

  To update:

  ```
  ibmcloud plugin update
  ```
  {: pre}

  To view installed plugins and versions:

  ```
  ibmcloud plugin list
  ```
  {: pre}


3. Generate a public SSH key to provision Virtual Server Instances (VSIs).

You may have a public SSH key already. Look for a file called ``id_rsa.pub`` under an ``.ssh`` directory under your home directory, for example, ``/Users/<USERNAME>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``. The file starts with ``ssh-rsa`` and ends with your email address.

If you do not have a public SSH key or if you forgot the password of an existing one, generate a new one by running the ``ssh-keygen`` command and following the prompts.


To learn how to create a Virtual Private Cloud in different IBM Cloud regions, see our [Regions](/docs/infrastructure/vpc/vpc-regions.html) topic.
{: tip}


## Step 1: Log in to IBM Cloud.
{: #step-1-log-in-to-ibm-cloud}

If you have a federated account:
```
ibmcloud login -sso
```
{: pre}

otherwise

```
ibmcloud login
```
{: pre}

## Step 2: Create a VPC and save the VPC ID.
{: #step-2-create-a-vpc-and-save-the-vpc-id}

Use the following command to create a VPC named _helloworld-vpc_.

```
ibmcloud is vpc-create helloworld-vpc
```
{: pre}

You should see output like this:

```
Creating VPC helloworld-vpc in resource group Default under account <Account Name> as user <User>...

ID        ba9e785a-3e10-418a-811c-56cfe5669676   
Name      helloworld-vpc   
Default   no   
Created   1 second ago   
Status    available   
```
{:screen}

Save the ID in a variable so we can use it later, for example:

```
vpc="ba9e785a-3e10-418a-811c-56cfe5669676"
```
{: pre}

## Step 3: Create a subnet and save the subnet ID.
{: #step-3-create-a-subnet-and-save-the-subnet-id}

Let's pick the `us-south-2` zone for the subnet's location and call the subnet _helloworld-subnet_.

```
ibmcloud is subnet-create helloworld-subnet $vpc us-south-2 --ipv4-address-count 8
```
{: pre}

You should see output like this:

```
Creating Subnet helloworld-subnet in resource group Default under account <Account Name> as user <User>...

ID               50ba0da9-279a-4791-b7cb-cd3d7b2bc14d

VPC              helloworld-vpc(ba9e785a-3e10-418a-811c-56cfe5669676)   
```
{:screen}

Save the ID in a variable so we can use it later, for example:

```
subnet="50ba0da9-279a-4791-b7cb-cd3d7b2bc14"
```
{: pre}

Note that the status of the subnet is `pending` when it first is created. Before you can proceed, the subnet needs to move to `available` status, which takes a few seconds. To check the status of the subnet, run this command:

```
ibmcloud is subnet $subnet
```
{: pre}

## Step 4: Attach a public gateway.
{: #step-4-attach-a-public-gateway}

Attach a public gateway to the subnet to allow all attached resources to communicate with the public internet. 

To create a public gateway, run the following command:

```
ibmcloud is public-gateway-create my-gateway $vpc us-south-2
```
{: pre}

Save the ID in a variable so you can use it later, for example:

```
gateway="f94a91c7-95db-42f2-9949-93a7e8fb63fb"
```
{: pre}

To attach the public gateway to your subnet, run the following command:
```
ibmcloud is subnet-update $subnet --public-gateway-id $gateway
```
{: pre}


Only one public gateway per zone is allowed in a VPC, but that public gateway can be attached to multiple subnets in the zone. To find the public gateway for a zone, run the 'ibmcloud is public-gateways` command and look for the particular VPC and Zone values.
{: tip}

You should see output like this:

```

```
{: screen}

## Step 5: Create an SSH Key in IBM Public Cloud.
{: #step-5-create-an-ssh-key-in-ibm-public-cloud}

You'll use the key to provision a virtual server instance. You can use the same key to provision multiple virtual server instances.

Keys only can be added initially as part of creating a VSI. No tooling exists to add keys later.
{:tip}

To see the available keys in your IBM Cloud account, run this command:

```
ibmcloud is keys
```
{: pre}

To create a key, run the following command. Substitute the path to your `id_rsa.pub` file.

```
ibmcloud is key-create helloworld-key @$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
{: pre}

You should see output like this:

```
Creating key helloworld-key in resource group Default under account <Account Name> as user <User>...

Created          now   
```
{:screen}

Save the ID in a variable so we can use it later, for example:

```
key="859b4e97-7540-4337-9c64-384792b85653"
```

## Step 6: Select a profile and image for the virtual server instance.
{: #step-6-select-a-profile-and-image-for-the-virtual-server-instance}

To list all available instance profiles, run the following command:

```
ibmcloud is instance-profiles
```
{: pre}

To list all available images, run the following command:

```
ibmcloud is images
```
{: pre}

Let's pick instance profile `b-2x8` and image `ubuntu-16.04-amd64`. To get the image ID of `ubuntu-16.04-amd64`, run the following command:

```
image=$(ibmcloud is images | grep "ubuntu-16.04-amd64" | cut -d" " -f1)
```
{: pre}

## Step 7: Provision a Virtual Server Instance.
{: #step-7-provision-a-virtual-server-instance}

```
ibmcloud is instance-create helloworld-vsi $vpc us-south-2 b-2x8 $subnet 1000 --image-id $image --key-ids $key
```
{: pre}

Keys only can be added initially as part of creating the VSI. No tooling exists to add keys later.
{:tip}

You should see output like this:

```
Creating instance helloworld-vsi in resource group Default under account <Account Name> as user <User>...

Zone              us-south-2   
```
{:screen}

Save the ID of the instance in a variable so we can use it later:

```
vsi=4562c5c0-9cf7-4406-bc90-ab4baea91057
{: pre}
```

Also save the ID of the primary network interface `Primary Intf` in a variable so we can use it later:

```
nic="2e850924-b5d7-4386-a778-03556d5850c1"
```
{:pre}

Note that the status of the instance is `pending` when it first is created. Before you can proceed, the instance needs to move to `running` status, which takes a few minutes. To check the status of the instance, run this command:

```
ibmcloud is instance $vsi
```
{: pre}

## Step 8: Create a Floating IP address.
{: #step-8-create-a-floating-ip-address}

You need a Floating IP address so you can log in to the virtual server instance (VSI) from the internet.

```
ibmcloud is floating-ip-reserve helloworld-fip --nic-id $nic
```
{: pre}

You should see output like this:

```
Creating floating ip helloworld-fip in resource group Default under account <Account Name> as user <User>...

ID               b9d1cc1f-67db-40e3-81de-9228465170a5

Target IP        10.0.1.5   
Created          now   
Status           available   
Zone             us-south-2   
```
{:screen}

Save the `Address` in a variable so we can use it later:

```
address=169.61.181.53
```
{: pre}

## Step 9: Add a rule to the default security group for SSH.
{: #step-9-add-a-rule-to-the-default-security-grop-for-ssh}

Find the security group for the VPC:

```
ibmcloud is vpc-sg $vpc
```
{: pre}

You should see output like this:
```
Getting default security group of vpc ba9e785a-3e10-418a-811c-56cfe5669676 under account <Account Name> as user <User>...

{:screen}

Save the ID in a variable so we can use it later:

```
sg=2d364f0a-a870-42c3-a554-000000981149
```
{: pre}

Now create the rule to allow SSH:

```
ibmcloud is sg-rulec $sg inbound tcp --port-min=22 --port-max=22
```
{: pre}

You should see output like this:

```
Creating rule for security group 2d364f0a-a870-42c3-a554-000000981149 under account <Account Name> as user <User>...

{:screen}

## Step 10: Create a block storage data volume.
{: #step-10-create-a-block-storage-data-volume}

Run this command to create a block storage data volume. Specify a name for your volume, volume profile, and the zone where you are creating the volume. To attach a block storage data volume to an instance, the instance and the block storage data volume must be created in the same zone.

To see a list of volume profiles, run:

```
ibmcloud is volume-profiles
```
{: pre}

Profiles can be general-purpose (3 IOPS/GB), 5iops-tier, 10-iops-tier, and custom.
See [About Block Storage for VPC](/docs/infrastructure/block-storage-is?topic=block-storage-is-block-storage-about#capacity-performance)
for information about volume capacity and IOPS ranges based on the volume profile you select.  

```
ibmcloud is volume-create helloworld-vol custom us-south-2 --iops 1000
```
{: pre}

You will see output like this:

```
Creating volume helloworld-vol in resource group Default under account <Account Name> as user <User>...

ID                                      933c8781-f7f5-4a8f-8a2d-3bfc711788ee

Zone                                    us-south-2
Volume Attachment Instance Reference    none
```
{:screen}

Save the ID of the volume in a variable so we can use it later:

```
vol=933c8781-f7f5-4a8f-8a2d-3bfc711788ee
```
{: pre}

Note that the status of the volume is `pending` when it first is created. Before you can proceed, the volume needs to move to `available` status, which takes a few minutes. 

To check the status of the volume, run this command:

```
ibmcloud is volume $vol
```
{: pre}

## Step 11: Attach a block storage data volume to an instance.
{: #step-11-attach-a-block-storage-data-volume-to-an-instance}

Use the following command to attach the volume to the virtual server instance, using the variables we created:

```
ibmcloud is instance-volume-attachment-add helloworld-vol-attachment $vsi $vol --auto-delete true
```
{: pre}

## Step 12: Log in to your virtual server instance using your private SSH key.
{: #step-12-log-in-to-your-virtual-server-instance-using-your-private-ssh-key}

For example, you can use a command of this form:

```
ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa root@$address
```
{:pre}

You'll receive a response similar to the example that follows. When you're prompted to continue connecting, type `yes`.

```

{:screen}

## Step 13: Hello, World!
{: #step-13-hello-world}

Run the following command in the terminal window:

```
echo `hostname` says "Hello, World!"
```
{:pre}

You should see the following output:

```
helloworld-vsi says Hello, World!
```
{:screen}

## Step 14: (Optional) Start using your block storage data volume
{: #step-14-optional-start-using-your-block-storage-data-volume}

To use your block storage volume as a filesystem, you'll need to partition the volume, format the volume, and then mount it as a filesystem.

On Linux, run the following command to list all block storage volumes from your instance:

```
lsblk
```
{:pre}

You should see output like this:

```
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0  100G  0 disk 
├─xvda1 202:1    0  256M  0 part /boot
└─xvda2 202:2    0 99.8G  0 part /
xvdc    202:32   0  100G  0 disk 
xvdp    202:240  0   64M  0 disk 
```
{:screen}

Volume `xvdc` is your new block storage data volume. 

Run the following command to partition the volume. To begin, use command `n` for new partition.

```
fdisk /dev/xvdc
```
{:pre}

Format the volume.

```
/sbin/mkfs -t ext3 /dev/xvdc
```
{:pre}

Label the volume as "hellovol".

```
/sbin/e2label /dev/xvdc /hellovol
```
{:pre}

Create the directory and mount the volume as a filesystem.

```
mkdir /hellovol
mount /dev/xvdc /hellovol
```
{: codeblock}

To see your new filesystem, run the following command:

```
df -k
```
{:pre}

You should see output like this:

```

```
{:screen}

To change directory into your new filesystem and create a file, do something like this:

```
cd /hellovol
touch hellovolume
```
{:codeblock}
